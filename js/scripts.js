It has been found in leaf litter in both primary and secondary forests, preferring to live near slow-moving waters (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). This species exhibits uniparental male care (Weygoldt 1987; Zimmermann and Zimmermann 1988). After the female deposits the eggs in a ground nest, they are periodically moistened by the male parent (hydric brooding) (Savage 2002; Guyer and Donnelly 2005). Once the eggs are hatched, the male transports his offspring to aquatic rearing sites by carrying five to ten tadpoles at a time on his back (Donnelly et al. 1990; Caldwell et al. 1994). In about two months they metamorphose into froglets of about 12 mm (Savage 2002). </p> <p> <a href='https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Phyllobates&where-species=lugubris'>Visit Amphibia Web to learn more</a></p>");

Males defend territories, approximately 3 m apart from other males (Walls 1994). The female approaches the male to initiate breeding. It is the role of the male to tend to the terrestrial clutch of eggs (3-17 eggs), and to keep them moist by periodically emptying their bladders on the eggs (hydric brooding) until they hatch (after 5-15 days). Males may protect more than one clutch at a time. The female then carries the individual tadpoles (1-2) to separate, water filled leaf axils of bromeliads or other plants. The female lays unfertilized eggs in with the tadpoles to serve as a food source. Adults of this species primarily consume ants. </p> <p> <a href='https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Oophaga&where-species=pumilio '>Visit Amphibia Web to learn more</a></p>");

It prefers the leaf litter of forested valleys with streams (Leenders 2001). This species has parental care, with the male parent attending the clutch of eggs up to three times a day and engaging in hydric brooding (Savage 2002).A few days to a week after the eggs hatch, the male will allow some or all of his tadpoles to crawl up on his back (Savage 2002). He then transports from one to thirteen larvae at a time, carrying them for 1-2 days, to a water source.  </p> <p> <a href='https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Phyllobates&where-species=vittatus '>Visit Amphibia Web to learn more</a></p>")

This species is highly territorial (Goodman 1971; Crump 1972; Bolaños 1990; van Wijngaarden and van Gool 1994), showing male-male physical aggression (Goodman 1971; Crump 1972). Territoriality in this species involves defending calling sites and oviposition sites (Bolaños 1990), and is vocally mediated (van Wijngaarden and van Gool 1994). </p> <p> <a href='https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Oophaga&where-species=granulifera'>Visit Amphibia Web to learn more</a></p>");
